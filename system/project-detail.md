# Matching Card Game - Project Details & To-Do Checklist

## Project Summary
A memory-based matching card game with 16 cards (8 pairs) arranged in a 4x4 grid. Players flip cards to find matching pairs, with timer tracking and leaderboard functionality.

## Development To-Do Checklist

### 1. Project Setup & Structure
- [ ] Initialize project structure and folders
- [ ] Set up build configuration (HTML/CSS/JS or framework)
- [ ] Create main game files (index.html, style.css, script.js)
- [ ] Set up responsive design framework/grid system

### 2. Game Core Logic
- [ ] Implement card data structure (8 unique card types)
- [ ] Create card shuffling algorithm for random placement
- [ ] Build game state management system
  - [ ] Game states: not-started, playing, paused, completed
  - [ ] Card states: face-down, face-up, matched
- [ ] Implement match detection logic
- [ ] Add game completion detection (all pairs matched)

### 3. User Interface Development
- [ ] Design 4x4 card grid layout
- [ ] Create card flip animations
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for matches/mismatches
- [ ] Design timer display component
- [ ] Create leaderboard interface
- [ ] Add game control buttons (start/restart/pause)
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile/desktop

### 4. Timer System
- [ ] Build timer functionality
  - [ ] Start timer on first card flip
  - [ ] Real-time display (minutes:seconds format)
  - [ ] Stop timer when game completes
- [ ] Integrate timer with game state
- [ ] Add timer reset functionality

### 5. Leaderboard System
- [ ] Design leaderboard data structure
- [ ] Implement score recording system
- [ ] Create leaderboard sorting (ascending by time)
- [ ] Add player name/initial input
- [ ] Implement data persistence
  - [ ] Choose storage method (localStorage/database)
  - [ ] Add save/load functionality
- [ ] Create leaderboard display interface

### 6. Game Mechanics Implementation
- [ ] Card flip interaction handling
- [ ] Two-card selection limit enforcement
- [ ] Match validation and feedback
- [ ] Mismatch handling (cards flip back)
- [ ] Matched pairs remain face-up
- [ ] Game completion triggering

### 7. Visual Design & Animations
- [x] Design card faces and backs
  - [x] Card fronts: 8 unique airline logos (Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, AirAsia, EVA Air, Lufthansa)

- [x] Implement smooth flip animations
- [x] Add match/mismatch visual feedback
- [x] Create game completion celebration
- [x] Style timer and leaderboard components
- [x] Add hover effects and transitions

### 8. Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test game logic thoroughly
- [ ] Verify timer accuracy
- [ ] Test leaderboard functionality
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

### 9. Polish & Enhancement
- [ ] Add sound effects (optional)
- [ ] Implement difficulty levels (optional)
- [ ] Add game statistics tracking
- [ ] Create tutorial/help section
- [ ] Add game settings/preferences

### 10. Deployment & Documentation
- [ ] Prepare production build
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Set up hosting/deployment
- [ ] Final testing in production environment
